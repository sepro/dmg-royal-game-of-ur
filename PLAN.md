# Royal Game of Ur - Game Boy DMG Development Plan

## Overview

This plan breaks down the development into manageable phases, each building on the previous one. Each phase results in a testable milestone. The plan assumes familiarity with GBDK-2020 and Game Boy hardware constraints (4 colors, 8x8 tiles, 40 sprites max, etc.).

## Phase 13: Add Sound

Background music needs to be added.

Sound effects need to be added to dice rolls, selecting menu items (difficulty, opponent)

A happy or sad chime should sound upon winning or losing.

### Assets

- Sounds and background music made with hUGEtracker
